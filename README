Mrs. Potts:
Audio Visualizer

Mrs. Potts is an audio visualizer that first takes in a audio file and then it processes into discrete data points. Then, 
it visualizes the beat to be in pulsing action of the teapot, pitch to be the color shade, and volume to be the amount of 
teapot that is getting colored. It uses OpenGl and Glsl Shader to update the beat, pitch, volume data from audio file, and
the video is shown on OpenGl window.

MUSICAL TEAPOT <insert mrs potts meme>

How to Run:
	First, download the zipfile of the source code/git clone this repo. 
  Then, make sure to locate the csv files generated from step 1, since the relative path is used as command line input for 
  the run.
  
Getting beat & pitch data: 
  Start by downloading and installing the Librosa library (http://librosa.github.io/librosa/index.html)
  In the beatTrack.py file, change the 'filename' variable to be the path to the audio file you want to use. 
  Then run, 'python3 beatTrack.py'
  
  For pitch you will do the same steps. Change the 'filename' variable and run, 'python3 pitch_extract.py'
  
  Beat will output a time series showing the time in seconds of every beat.
  Pitch will output a series of numbers 0-11. 
  0 = C, 1 = C#, 2 = D, 3 = D#, etc
  There is one pitch for every frame in the audio clip.
  

Run details:
  1. Unzip the zip file of source code.
  2. Open terminal and navigate into the unzipped folder path.
  3. Run ‘make’ in command line to build Mrs. Potts. 
  4. Run desired command line input.

Command Line Input Format: 
  ./final_project <vertex shader> <fragment shader> <volume_file> <pitch_file> <beat_file>
  Example: ./final_project kernels/bailey.vert kernels/bailey.frag data/volume.csv data/pitch.csv data/beat.csv
